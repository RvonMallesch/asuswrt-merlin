asuswrt-merlin-modem-support
============================

This is an enhanced version of Asuswrt - the firmware used by all recent Asus routers and modem-routers. 
This is a fork of merlins excellent custom router firmware and adds support for modem routers.

So far I have added support for the DSL-AC68U. Adding support for other routers should be straight forward. Unfortunately I only have the DSL-AC68U to test on.
